## Maze Generation

There are two maze generators implemented:

1. ```SimpleMazeGenerator```
      
      Generates a maze based on the pixels of an image.
2. ```ImageMazeGenerator``` 
   
    Generates a maze based on ascii characters in a text file.


## Maze Solving Algorithm

The maze is solved by a simple back tracking algorithm which is trying all variations to find the exit.
